\textbf{Zero Sum Game:} In zero sum game sum of payoff's of all the players for each outcome of the game, is zero. Which means if one player is able to improve his payoff by using some good strategy the payoff of others is going to decrease.\\
\textbf{Constant Sum Game:} In zero sum game sum of payoff's of all the players for each outcome of the game, is a constant. 
    Zero-sum games are true games of conflict.Any gain on a player's side comes at the expense of his opponents.Think of dividing up a pie.The size of the pie doesn't change. Its all about redistribution of the pieces between the players.


Consider the game of Chess. There are two players one playing with White pieces and one playing with Black pieces. There are three possible outcomes.\\ 
\mathrm { O } =\{\text{Black Wins, White Wins, Draw}\}\\
Lets define payoffs as \\
\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{payoffs}
    \label{tab:table2}
    \begin{tabular}{l|S|r|l}
    \textbf{} & \textbf{BlackWins} & \textbf{WhiteWins} & \textbf{Draw}\\ 
      \hline
      $\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{b}} & 1 & 0 & $\frac{1}{2}$$ \\
      $\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{w}} & 0 & 1 & $\frac{1}{2}$$ \\
      Sum & 1 & 1 & 1
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
This is a constant sum game, sum of payoffs is constant. If white increases his payoff by a win the payoff of black goes down and vice versa.
This is called strictly competitive games. Win for one player is loss for the other
